## Overview
This landing page is designed for a fictional cloud platform, CloudNova. It features a hero section, solutions/features, a platform trust section, pricing, testimonials, about, and contact. The design is minimal, professional, and fully responsive.

## Project Structure
```
index.html        # Main HTML file
styles.css        # Main CSS file
README.md         # This documentation
```

## How the Code Works

### HTML Structure
- **`<header>`**: Contains the navigation bar and brand.
- **`<main>`**: Contains all main content sections:
  - **Hero**: Main headline, highlights, and a side image.
  - **Solutions**: Feature cards for core services.
  - **Platform**: Security & trust features in a card layout.
  - **Pricing**: Simple, clear pricing cards.
  - **Testimonials**: Customer feedback cards.
  - **About**: Company mission and careers.
  - **Contact**: Contact form and company info.
- **`<footer>`**: Brand, copyright, and links.

### Key Sections & Tags
- **`<section>`**: Used for each major content block, with descriptive `id` attributes for navigation and accessibility.
- **`<div class="container">`**: Centers and constrains content width.
- **`<ul>`, `<li>`**: Used for navigation, feature lists, and highlights.
- **`<form>`**: Contact form with labeled fields.
- **`<svg>`**: Inline icons for features and platform trust cards.
- **`<img>`**: Used for the hero side image (with online source for reliability and modern visuals).

### Classes & IDs
- **Classes**: Used for layout, styling, and component structure. They enable modular, reusable, and responsive design.
- **IDs**: Used for navigation (anchor links) and accessibility (ARIA labels).

### Why Online Images and SVGs?
- **Online images** (from Unsplash) are used for hero and media sections for high quality, fast loading, and no need for local storage.
- **SVG icons** are used for features and trust cards for scalability, clarity, and fast rendering.

### How to Modify or Extend
- **Change content**: Edit the text in `index.html`.
- **Change images**: Replace the image URLs or SVGs in the HTML.
- **Change colors or layout**: Edit CSS variables in `:root` or the relevant class in `styles.css`.
- **Add features**: Copy an existing card/section and update its content and icon.

### Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Semantic HTML and ARIA labels are used for accessibility.
- CSS grid and flexbox ensure the site works on all devices.
- Color contrast and focus styles are included for usability.

## For Developers & Colleagues

This section is for anyone new to the codebase. It explains how to read, navigate, and extend the project:

- The code is organized into clear sections using semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- Each section (hero, solutions, platform, pricing, testimonials, about, contact) is wrapped in a `<section>` tag with a unique `id` for navigation and clarity.
- Classes are used for layout and styling. IDs are used for navigation and accessibility.
- SVG icons and online images are used for modern visuals and scalability.
- To add or change features, copy an existing card/section and update its content and icon.
- Accessibility and responsiveness are built in by default.

## Code Examples: HTML & CSS with Professional Explanations

This section provides annotated code samples from the project, with clear explanations of their structure and purpose. These examples are designed to help you quickly understand how each part of the landing page works, and how to extend or modify it following best practices.


### 1. Header & Navigation

**HTML:**
```html
<header class="site-header">
  <div class="container header-inner">
    <a class="brand" href="#">
      <span class="brand-mark">☁</span>
      <span class="brand-text">CloudNova</span>
    </a>
    <nav class="site-nav">
      <ul class="nav-list">
        <li><a href="#solutions">Solutions</a></li>
        <li><a class="btn btn-small btn-primary" href="#contact">Get started</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </div>
</header>
```
**Explanation:**
- The `<header>` element provides a consistent navigation bar at the top of every page.
- The `.brand` class groups the logo and brand name for easy identification.
- The navigation links are organized in a list for accessibility and easy styling.
- The "Get started" button uses `.btn-primary` for visual emphasis and clear call-to-action.

**CSS:**
```css
.site-header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background: #fff;
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border);
}
.site-nav .btn-primary {
  color: #fff !important;
  background: var(--black);
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `.site-header` ensures the navigation remains visible as users scroll.
- `.btn-primary` applies a high-contrast style to important navigation buttons, improving usability.

### 2. Hero Section

**HTML:**
```html
<section class="hero">
  <div class="container hero-inner">
    <div class="hero-copy">
      <h1>Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure That Scales With You</h1>
      <div class="hero-cta">
        <a class="btn btn-primary" href="#contact">Start free trial</a>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="hero-visual">
      <picture class="hero-img-wrap">
        <img class="hero-img" src="..." alt="Cloud illustration" />
      </picture>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```
**Explanation:**
- The hero section is the first thing users see and communicates the main value proposition.
- The layout uses a grid to place the headline and call-to-action beside a relevant image, making the message clear and visually appealing.
- The image is responsive and includes alt text for accessibility.

**CSS:**
```css
.hero-inner {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1.2fr 1fr;
  gap: 32px;
}
.hero-img {
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 16px;
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `.hero-inner` uses CSS Grid to create a two-column layout, ensuring content is well-organized on all screen sizes.
- `.hero-img` ensures the image scales with the container and has rounded corners for a modern look.
